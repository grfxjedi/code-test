# CodeTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.

This is built to show an example of a project using Angular 8 w/ NgRx

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Node.js installed on your development machine.

* For Node.js and NPM, I prefer to use the [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). This project was built using Node v8.11.3 and NPM v6.9.0
* **OR** you can download and install Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.


## Local dependencies
From the project directory run:

```
$ npm install
```

After that you should be able to build and run locally.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server and json DB. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view database. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
